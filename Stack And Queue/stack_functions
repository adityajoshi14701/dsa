# Creating a new stack :
Stack stk = new Stack();     or    Stack<type> stk = new Stack<>();  

# Methods :
1. empty() -> (boolean) : checks if stack is empty or not
2. push(e) -> (e) : insert element at the top of the stack
3. pop() -> (e) : remove the top element of the stack and return the same element as the value of the function
4. peek() -> (e) : return the top lement without removing it
5. search(Object o) -> (int) : search the given object and return it's index


## Prioritize use of Deque over Stack
The Stack class in Java is a legacy class and inherits from Vector in Java. It is a thread-safe class and hence involves overhead when we do not need thread safety. It is recommended to use ArrayDeque for stack implementation as it is more efficient in a single-threaded environment.
